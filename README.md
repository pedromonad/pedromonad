## Hi there 👋

My name is Pedro Barros, and I am a Brazilian full-stack developer. I started my career in 2012, working initially as a webmaster. Since then, I have been involved in various ReactJS, Redux, NextJS, Angular and Typescript projects.

I am a hard-working and passionate developer who constantly tries to improve my skills and is ready to solve any challenges.

Recognizing the need to understand more about the business rules I am involved in, I expanded my expertise to backend technologies, particularly NodeJS and .NET (C#), PHP, and Java. 

My passion is learning new things 💝
